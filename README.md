This project is a mini clone of the AirBnb website.

Technologies used:
* Python
* MySQL
* Peewee
* Flask

It is under construction.
** As per May 22, 2017, the code is being refactored to focus on getting the api to work ie connections to MySQL should work from both server and local machine,
tables and data should be properly loaded into existing databases. **

Each new branch should be merged into Master after latest update has been validated by peer review.

A special thanks to [Gloria Bwandungi](https://github.com/nappybrainiac), [Zee Adams](https://github.com/WaBlueKey), and [Damian Ali](https://github.com/DamianAli) for their help and support in building this project.
